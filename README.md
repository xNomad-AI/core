## üîê Secure TEE Configuration

Each NFT agent operates with a TEE-protected private account, ensuring secure and private management of assets corresponding to NFT holders. The TEE environment is powered by **Phala Network**, providing robust protection for sensitive operations.

### Development Environment

For development purposes, you can use docker-compose to launch Phala Docker, providing a simulated TEE environment.

### Production Environment

In production, the core server operates within a Phala Confidential VM, with the TEE environment secured by the Phala Network to ensure robust end-to-end security and compliance for real-world deployments. For more details, refer to the Phala Cloud Documentation.

With this setup, you can confidently manage NFT-related assets in a fully private and secure manner, leveraging the power of TEE to enhance user trust and platform reliability.
